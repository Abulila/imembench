This project contains the Spark workloads in BigDataBench.
This project is based on Spark-1.1.0 and scala-2.10.4.

How to use BigDataBench's Spark workloads?

Preparations:
Make sure that Spark has been successfully installed.
Configure you bash environment:
$SPARK_HOME points to the path where spark installed;
Add $SPARK_HOME/bin to the $PATH variable.
Assume the bigdatabench-spark_2.10-1.1.0.jar file locates in $JAR_FILE.
The JAR_FILE file you can find in /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark+Shark/JAR_FILE;
Add $JAR_FILE/bigdatabench-spark_2.10-1.1.0.jar to environment

The workloads inculde:
   Sort, Grep, WordCount, NaiveBayesTrainer, ConnectedComponent, PageRank, KMeans
How to run:
   Sort, Grep, WordCount
            To generate data:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/MicroBenchmarks
                       sh genData_MicroBenchmarks.sh
            To run workloads:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/MicroBenchmarks
                       sh run_MicroBenchmarks.sh
   NaiveBayesTrainer
            To generate data:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/E-commerce
                       sh genData_naivebayes.sh
            To run workloads:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/E-commerce  
                       sh run_naivebayes.sh
   ConnectedComponent
            To generate data:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/SNS/Connected_Components 
                       sh genData_connectedComponents.sh
            To run workloads:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/SNS/Connected_Components
                       sh run_connectComponents.sh
   KMeans
            To generate data:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/SNS/Kmeans
                       sh genData_Kmeans.sh
            To run wordloads:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/SNS/Kmeans
                       sh run_Kmeans.sh
   Pagerank
            To generate data:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/SearchEngine/Pagerank
                       sh genData_PageRank.sh
            To run wordloads:
                       cd /BigDataBench_V4.0_Spark/SearchEngine/Pagerank
                       sh run_Pagerank.sh
